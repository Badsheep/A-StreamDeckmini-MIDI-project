# A-StreamDeckmini-MIDI-project

created by Badsheep,

I'm a beginner in those kind of stuffs so please don't judge me bad :)
The goal is to exchange Midi Datas between a Stresm Deck Mini and MAX (Cycling 74)
It uses Midi Control Change (n°2 and n°4)

2 functions in my case :
Activate the audio inputs of the soundcard to be able to hear a vinyl turntable connected on it
Activate a compressor on the audio output.
